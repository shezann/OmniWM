description: Complete reference for every table, array, key, and default in OmniWM's settings.toml.

Complete reference for `settings.toml`, in the file's canonical order. The authoritative schema is [`CanonicalTOMLConfig.swift`](https://github.com/BarutSRB/OmniWM/blob/main/Sources/OmniWM/Core/Config/CanonicalTOMLConfig.swift); defaults come from [`SettingsExport.swift`](https://github.com/BarutSRB/OmniWM/blob/main/Sources/OmniWM/Core/Config/SettingsExport.swift) and [`BuiltInSettingsDefaults.swift`](https://github.com/BarutSRB/OmniWM/blob/main/Sources/OmniWM/Core/Config/BuiltInSettingsDefaults.swift).

:::caution
The current schema is strict — a missing required key in a version 4 file invalidates the whole file, `hotkeys` must list every assignable action exactly once, and an enumerated string key must use one of its listed values (an unknown value rejects the whole file, exactly like a missing key). Edit values in place; see [Configuration](/config/configuration/).
:::

**Conventions**

- Keys marked *(optional)* may be omitted; every other key is required.
- **Colors** are tables with `red`, `green`, `blue`, `alpha` floats in `0.0`–`1.0`.
- **`singleWindowFit`** values are strings: `"fill"`, a custom size `"WIDTHxHEIGHT"` (e.g. `"1920x1080"`), or — Niri only — `"container_primary_span"`. `"fill"` is the Settings window's "Full Screen" fit: the lone window takes the fullscreen layout frame, so it follows `fullscreenUsesOuterGaps` rather than the regular tiling gaps.
- Values listed as enums accept exactly the raw strings shown.

## File schema

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `schemaVersion` | integer | `6` | Version of the complete `settings.toml` schema. This top-level key appears before the first table. |

The canonical file declares:

```toml
schemaVersion = 6
```

An absent version identifies a legacy version 0 file, while OmniWM v0.6.4 emitted version 1. OmniWM upgrades version 0 through 5 files sequentially in memory before strict version 6 validation, retaining the compatibility guarantee for settings emitted by v0.6.2 through v0.6.4. The version 2 to version 3 step moves the old flat routing rows into one saved arrangement, the version 3 to version 4 step adds the unassigned `swapWithMaster` hotkey entry, the version 4 to version 5 step adds `toggleWindowManagement`, and the version 5 to version 6 step adds `bringFocusedWindowFrontAndCenter`. A successful upgrade creates an exact write-once `settings.toml.pre-v6` or `settings.toml.pre-v6.1` backup, then atomically rewrites canonical TOML once; this can reorder keys and removes comments, while preserving unrecognized keys when their owner can be matched safely. Valid release migrations never use the `.corrupt` recovery slots. Older schema-less files are attempted but remain untouched with defaults active if they cannot validate, and files declaring a newer unsupported version remain untouched with configuration writes blocked. See [Automatic version upgrades](/config/configuration/#automatic-version-upgrades) for the migration rules and recovery behavior.

## general

Global switches: hotkeys, Hyper key, default layout, sleep, updates, IPC, animations.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `hotkeysEnabled` | boolean | `true` | Master switch for all global hotkeys. |
| `systemHyperTrigger` | string | `"None"` | Physical trigger for Hyper: `None`, a key name (`CapsLock`, `F13`–`F20`, `Control`/`RightControl`, `Option`/`RightOption`, `Shift`/`RightShift`, `Command`/`RightCommand`), or `MouseButton3`/`MouseButton4`/`MouseButton5`. |
| `hyperKeyModifiers` | string | `"Control+Option+Shift+Command"` | Modifier set Hyper expands to: `+`-joined names, at least two of Control/Option/Shift/Command. |
| `defaultLayoutType` | string | `"niri"` | Layout used by workspaces whose own `layoutType` is `default`: `niri` or `dwindle`. |
| `preventSleepEnabled` | boolean | `false` | Prevents idle display sleep while your user session is active. |
| `updateChecksEnabled` | boolean | `true` | Automatic update checks. |
| `ipcEnabled` | boolean | `false` | Enables the IPC server used by `omniwmctl`. |
| `animationsEnabled` | boolean | `true` | Animates window layout changes. |

## focus

Pointer-driven focus and monitor-edge focus/move behavior.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `followsMouse` | boolean | `false` | Focuses a managed window when the pointer enters it, no click needed. |
| `raiseOnMouseFocus` | boolean | `false` | Also raises the window when focus-follows-mouse focuses it. |
| `lockModifier` | string | `"off"` | Modifier that holds focus in place while pressed: `off`, `option`, `leftOption`, `rightOption`, `command`, `leftCommand`, `rightCommand`, `control`, `leftControl`, `rightControl`, `shift`, `leftShift`, `rightShift`. |
| `moveMouseToFocusedWindow` | boolean | `false` | Moves the pointer to the window that gains focus. |
| `followsWindowToMonitor` | boolean | `false` | Keeps focus on a window when it moves to another monitor. |
| `crossesMonitorAtEdge` | boolean | `false` | Directional focus continues onto the neighboring monitor at the screen edge. |
| `moveCrossesMonitorAtEdge` | boolean | `false` | Directional window move continues onto the neighboring monitor at the screen edge. |

## mouseWarp

Cursor warping across the monitor arrangement (used with `routing.mode = "custom"`).

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `margin` | integer | `1` | Edge margin in pixels used when warping the cursor between monitors. |
| `enabled` | boolean | `true` | Enables cursor warping between monitors. |
| `constrainToArrangement` | boolean | `false` | Constrains the cursor to the configured monitor arrangement. |

## routing

How monitors are arranged for cross-monitor focus, move, and warp.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mode` | string | `"macOS"` | `macOS` follows the system display arrangement; `custom` selects a saved arrangement for the connected displays. |
| `arrangements` | array of tables | `[]` | Saved custom routing grids, written as `[[routing.arrangements]]` with nested `[[routing.arrangements.monitors]]` rows. |

Each arrangement has a required `id` UUID and a required `monitors` array. Each monitor row requires `monitorName`, `gridColumn`, and `gridRow`; `monitorDisplayUUID` and `monitorDisplayId` are optional identity fields. Grid coordinates are integers. Settings records display UUIDs automatically; matching uses UUID first and the existing display-ID/name fallback for displays without UUIDs.

OmniWM selects the first exact connected-set match. Otherwise, it selects the arrangement with the fewest total rows that contains every connected display; the first arrangement wins ties. It then uses only the connected displays' grid positions. An uncovered set or an invalid selected grid follows macOS. Resolution, enumeration order, and macOS placement do not affect selection.

Editing, resetting, or finishing Monitor Setup saves exactly the connected set and retains an existing exact arrangement's ID. An edit to an inherited grid creates a separate arrangement without changing its larger source. Connecting displays or opening Settings does not create arrangements. Keep arrangement IDs stable when editing by hand so unrecognized configuration fields remain associated with the right arrangement.

```toml
[routing]
mode = "custom"

[[routing.arrangements]]
id = "FBE84D50-689B-4B97-A820-B8E3BFD581B7"

[[routing.arrangements.monitors]]
gridColumn = 0
gridRow = 1
monitorDisplayUUID = "8D575171-D0DD-43BB-9FEF-356E6B7C917D"
monitorName = "Built-in Retina Display"

[[routing.arrangements.monitors]]
gridColumn = 0
gridRow = 0
monitorDisplayUUID = "3EFD184C-D5D3-40EF-AF27-14C4222A467B"
monitorName = "DELL U2720Q"
```

For no saved arrangements, use `arrangements = []` inside `[routing]` and omit the array-of-table entries. The example UUIDs above are illustrative; use the identities recorded for your displays by **Settings > Monitors**.

## gaps

Gaps between tiled windows and screen edges (points).

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `size` | float | `16.0` | Stored inner gap between tiled windows. An enabled focus border may raise the runtime-effective gap without rewriting this value. |
| `fullscreenUsesOuterGaps` | boolean | `false` | Fullscreen layout frames keep the outer gaps. |
| `outer.left` | float | `0.0` | Outer gap at the left screen edge. |
| `outer.right` | float | `0.0` | Outer gap at the right screen edge. |
| `outer.top` | float | `0.0` | Outer gap measured from the physical top edge of each display. The menu bar height is subtracted first and the result is clamped at 0, so a display without a menu bar needs a smaller value than the main display for the same visual gap below the menu bar. |
| `outer.bottom` | float | `0.0` | Outer gap at the bottom screen edge. |

Per-display values come from [`[[monitorGapOverrides]]`](#per-monitor-overrides). An override row is matched to a connected display by its display UUID first and otherwise by display id plus name, so a hand-edited row whose id or name no longer matches any display is silently ignored and the global values apply.

## niri

Options for the scrolling (Niri) layout.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `visibleContainerCount` | integer | `2` | How many containers (columns) share the viewport side by side. |
| `infiniteLoop` | boolean | `false` | Treats the column strip as a loop instead of a bounded row. |
| `centerFocusedColumn` | string | `"never"` | When to center the focused column: `never`, `always`, `onOverflow`. |
| `alwaysCenterSingleColumn` | boolean | `false` | Centers the column when a workspace holds only one. |
| `singleWindowFit` | string | `"fill"` | Size of a lone window: `fill` (the "Full Screen" fit, which uses the fullscreen layout frame and honors `fullscreenUsesOuterGaps`), `container_primary_span`, or `WIDTHxHEIGHT`. |
| `containerPrimarySpanPresets` *(optional)* | float array | `[1/3, 1/2, 2/3]` | Span fractions the span-cycling actions step through. |
| `defaultContainerPrimarySpan` *(optional)* | float | `0.5` | Primary-axis span fraction for new containers. |

## dwindle

Options for the Dwindle (BSP) layout.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `smartSplit` | boolean | `false` | Automatically chooses the split direction based on cursor position. |
| `defaultSplitRatio` | float | `1.0` | `1.0` = equal split, `<1.0` = first window smaller, `>1.0` = first window larger. |
| `splitWidthMultiplier` | float | `1.0` | Biases when vertical vs. horizontal splits are preferred. |
| `singleWindowFit` | string | `"fill"` | Size of a lone window: `fill` (the "Full Screen" fit, which uses the fullscreen layout frame and honors `fullscreenUsesOuterGaps`) or `WIDTHxHEIGHT` (no span mode in Dwindle). |
| `useGlobalGaps` | boolean | `true` | Uses the [`gaps`](#gaps) values; when `false`, the inner gap comes from a per-monitor `innerGap` override (falling back to `gaps.size`), clamped to the same 0–64 range as `gaps.size`. |
| `moveToRootStable` | boolean | `true` | Keeps a window on the same screen side when moving it to the root. |
| `centeredMaster` | boolean | `false` | Keeps one master window in the center with the other windows stacked in a left and a right column; new windows alternate sides starting on the right. Use the `Swap with Master` action to move the focused window into the center. |
| `masterRatio` | float | `0.5` | Share of the width the centered master takes (`0.2`–`0.8`); the side stacks split the rest. |

## frontAndCenter

Options for the **Bring Focused Window Front and Center** action (`Option + Shift + F` by default), which floats the frontmost app's focused window, sizes it to a share of the monitor under the pointer, centers it there, and raises it; a second press puts the window back. The whole table is optional and absent from files written before it existed.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sizeRatio` | float | `0.7` | Share of the monitor's visible frame the window takes on each axis (`0.2`–`1.0`), so it keeps the screen's aspect ratio. Per-display values come from [`[[monitorFrontAndCenterOverrides]]`](#per-monitor-overrides). |

## borders

Border drawn around the focused window.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | boolean | `true` | Draws the focused-window border. |
| `width` | float | `5.0` | Exterior border width in points. Managed layout frames use its physical-pixel ceiling as the minimum runtime inner and outer clearance while borders are enabled; stored gap values are unchanged. |
| `color` | color table | red ≈ `0.0846`, green `1.0`, blue ≈ `0.9793`, alpha `1.0` | Border color (default is a cyan accent). |

## overview

Zoom and colors for the Overview.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `zoom` | float | `1.0` | Overview zoom factor. |
| `backdrop` | color table | `0.05, 0.05, 0.08, 1.0` | Backdrop behind the zoomed-out workspaces. |
| `windowBorders.normal` | color table | `0.3, 0.3, 0.35, 0.5` | Border for windows at rest. |
| `windowBorders.hovered` | color table | `0.4, 0.6, 1.0, 1.0` | Border for the hovered window. |
| `windowBorders.selected` | color table | `0.3, 0.8, 0.4, 1.0` | Border for the selected window. |

## workspaceBar

The per-monitor workspace bar. Per-monitor exceptions live in [`monitorBarOverrides`](#per-monitor-overrides).

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | boolean | `true` | Shows the workspace bar. |
| `showLabels` | boolean | `true` | Shows workspace names next to their numbers. |
| `showFloatingWindows` | boolean | `false` | Includes floating windows' icons in workspace pills. |
| `windowLevel` | string | `"popup"` | Bar window level: `normal`, `floating`, `status`, `popup`, `screensaver`. |
| `position` | string | `"overlappingMenuBar"` | `overlappingMenuBar` or `belowMenuBar`. |
| `notchMode` | string | `"moveBelowMenuBar"` | Behavior on notched displays: `off`, `moveBelowMenuBar`, `splitActiveLeft`, `splitActiveRight`. |
| `notchActiveZoneWidth` | float | `180.0` | Width in points of the active zone around the notch. |
| `systemStatsButton` | boolean | `false` | Adds a system stats button to the bar. |
| `deduplicateAppIcons` | boolean | `false` | Collapses repeated icons of the same app within a pill. |
| `hideEmptyWorkspaces` | boolean | `false` | Hides pills for workspaces with no windows. |
| `excludedBundleIDs` | string array | `[]` | Bundle IDs whose windows never contribute icons to the bar. |
| `iconOverrides` | table | `{}` | Bundle ID → custom icon source (see below). |
| `reserveLayoutSpace` | boolean | `false` | Reserves tiled layout space using the configured bar height. |
| `revealModifier` | string | `"off"` | Reveal the bar by holding a modifier. Any value other than `off` makes the bar overlay-only: it reserves no layout space at all while the modifier is configured, not just while it is held. Values: `off`, `option`, `control`, `command`, `shift`, `controlOption`, `optionCommand`, `optionShift`, `controlCommand`, `controlShift`, `commandShift`, `controlOptionCommand`, `controlOptionShift`, `optionCommandShift`, `controlCommandShift`, `controlOptionCommandShift`. |
| `revealHoldMilliseconds` | float | `200.0` | How long the modifier must be held before the bar reveals. |
| `hideInNativeFullscreen` | boolean | `false` | Hides the bar while a native-fullscreen space is active. |
| `height` | float | `24.0` | Bar height in points. |
| `backgroundOpacity` | float | `0.1` | Bar background opacity (`0.0`–`1.0`). |
| `xOffset` | float | `0.0` | Horizontal offset in points. |
| `yOffset` | float | `0.0` | Vertical offset in points; positive values move the bar up, negative values move it down. |
| `accentColor` *(optional)* | color table | unset | Accent color override; unset uses the built-in accent. |
| `textColor` *(optional)* | color table | unset | Text color override; unset uses the built-in text color. |

`iconOverrides` maps a bundle ID to either an image file path — absolute, `~/`-relative, or relative to the `omniwm` config directory — or `bundle-resource:NAME` for an image resource inside that app's own bundle:

```toml
[workspaceBar.iconOverrides]
"com.apple.Safari" = "~/Pictures/safari-alt.png"
"com.mitchellh.ghostty" = "bundle-resource:AppIcon"
```

## gestures

Mouse and trackpad gestures.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `scrollEnabled` | boolean | `true` | Modifier + mouse scroll wheel scrolls along the Niri primary axis. |
| `scrollSensitivity` | float | `5.0` | Scroll gesture sensitivity. |
| `scrollModifierKey` | string | `"optionShift"` | Modifier for wheel scrolling: `optionShift` or `controlShift`. |
| `mouseMoveModifierKey` | string | `"option"` | Modifier for drag-to-swap of tiled windows in Niri and Dwindle (Niri also accepts `Shift` for insert): `off`, `option`, `control`, `command`, `controlOption`, `optionCommand`, `controlCommand`, `controlOptionCommand`. |

| `workspaceSwipeFingerCount` | integer | `3` | Workspace-swipe finger count: `2`, `3`, or `4`. |
| `workspaceSwipeAxis` | string | `"vertical"` | Workspace-swipe axis: `horizontal` or `vertical`. |
| `workspaceSwipeInvertDirection` | boolean | `true` | Natural direction for workspace swipes, independent of `invertDirection`: `true` means swipe left (or up) goes to the next workspace; `false` means swipe right (or down) goes to the next workspace. When the key is absent it follows `invertDirection`. |
| `workspaceSwipeDisablesSystemGesture` | boolean | `false` | While workspace swipe is on, turn off the macOS gesture that shares its fingers and axis (Mission Control for vertical, Swipe between full-screen applications for horizontal), and turn it back on when workspace swipe is off or OmniWM quits. Two-finger swipes are left alone. |
| `workspaceSwipeDistance` | float | `0.28` | Fraction of the trackpad the fingers must travel before a workspace swipe fires, from `0.08` to `0.6`. A fast flick switches sooner regardless. |

## statusBar

Extra readouts beside the menu bar icon.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `showWorkspaceName` | boolean | `false` | Shows the active workspace beside the menu bar icon. |
| `showAppNames` | boolean | `false` | Also shows the focused app's name. |
| `useWorkspaceId` | boolean | `false` | Shows the workspace number instead of its name. |

## hiddenBar

Menu-bar icon concealment (concealment requires macOS 27+).

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | boolean | `true` | Enables the Hidden Bar feature. |
| `hiddenBundleIDs` | string array | `[]` | Bundle IDs of menu-bar apps whose icons are concealed. |
| `rehideIntervalSeconds` | float | `5.0` | Seconds before revealed icons re-hide automatically. |

## clipboard

Clipboard history limits. History content itself is stored in the state directory, not in the config file.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `historyEnabled` | boolean | `false` | Enables clipboard history capture. |
| `maxItems` | integer | `200` | Maximum number of history entries. |
| `maxItemBytes` | integer | `8388608` | Maximum size of a single entry (8 MiB). |
| `maxTotalBytes` | integer | `67108864` | Maximum total history size (64 MiB). |

## quakeTerminal

The drop-down (Quake) terminal.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | boolean | `true` | Enables the Quake terminal. |
| `position` | string | `"center"` | Slide-in position: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `center`. |
| `widthPercent` | float | `50.0` | Width as a percentage of the screen. |
| `heightPercent` | float | `50.0` | Height as a percentage of the screen. |

| `backgroundEffect` | string | `"standardBlur"` | Background material: `standardBlur`, `glassRegular`, `glassClear`. |
| `backgroundBlurRadius` *(optional)* | integer | `0` | Background blur radius; `0` disables the extra blur. |
| `monitorMode` *(optional)* | string | `"focusedWindow"` | Which monitor it appears on: `mouseCursor`, `focusedWindow`, `mainMonitor`. |

## scratchpads

Optional labels for the ten scratchpad slots. A label replaces the slot number in the workspace bar and in `omniwmctl` output.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `labels` | table | `{}` | Slot number (`1`–`10`) → label string. |

```toml
[scratchpads.labels]
1 = "term"
2 = "notes"
```

## appearance

Appearance of OmniWM's own UI.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mode` | string | `"dark"` | `automatic`, `light`, or `dark`. |

## hotkeys

Array of tables — one entry per assignable action, each with an `id` (the action identifier) and a `binding`:

```toml
[[hotkeys]]
binding = "Option+1"
id = "switchWorkspace.1"

[[hotkeys]]
binding = "Unassigned"
id = "toggleScratchpad.1"
```

- `binding` is a human-readable chord: `+`-joined modifiers (`Control`, `Option`, `Shift`, `Command`, or the `Hyper` shorthand for the full [`hyperKeyModifiers`](#general) set) followed by a key name — or `"Unassigned"`. A `Left `/`Right ` prefix pins a modifier to one side (e.g. `"Left Option+H"`).
- The array is validated strictly: every assignable action must appear **exactly once**. An unknown, unassignable, duplicate, or missing action id rejects the whole file, so rebind by editing `binding` values in place — never add or remove entries.

The default bindings are listed in the [keyboard shortcuts guide](/guides/keyboard-shortcuts/); the full action list is visible in **Settings > Hotkeys** and via `omniwmctl query commands`.

## workspaces

Array of workspace definitions.

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string (UUID) | Stable identity; keep it unchanged when editing. |
| `name` | string | Workspace name; numeric names define the ordering and number-key targets. |
| `displayName` *(optional)* | string | Label shown in the bar instead of `name` (emoji welcome). |
| `monitorAssignment` | table | `type` = `main`, `secondary`, or `specificDisplay` (the latter carries an `output` value identifying the display). |
| `layoutType` | string | `default` (follow `general.defaultLayoutType`), `niri`, or `dwindle`. |

Default: nine workspaces named `1`–`9`, all Niri — `1`–`5` and `8`–`9` on the main monitor, `6` (shown as ❤️) and `7` (shown as 🚀) on the secondary, matching the default `Option + 1`–`9` bindings.

```toml
[[workspaces]]
displayName = "❤️"
id = "5953F2BF-A378-4266-91B2-287174C4FA4D"
layoutType = "niri"
name = "6"

[workspaces.monitorAssignment]
type = "secondary"
```

## appRules

Array of per-app window rules, editable in the **App Rules** window. Matchers select windows; the remaining fields say what to do with them.

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string (UUID) | Stable rule identity. |
| `bundleId` | string | App bundle ID to match (may be empty when an advanced matcher is used). |
| `appNameSubstring` *(optional)* | string | Matches on the app name. |
| `titleSubstring` *(optional)* | string | Matches on the window title. |
| `titleRegex` *(optional)* | string | Regex match on the window title; when both title matchers are set, the regex wins. |
| `axRole` *(optional)* | string | Matches the accessibility role. |
| `axSubrole` *(optional)* | string | Matches the accessibility subrole. |
| `layout` *(optional)* | string | `auto` (default), `tile`, or `float`. |
| `assignToWorkspace` *(optional)* | string | Workspace name the window is routed to. |
| `initialContainerPrimarySpan` *(optional)* | float | Initial Niri span for the window's container (`0.05`–`1.0`). |
| `minWidth` *(optional)* | float | Minimum layout width in points. |
| `minHeight` *(optional)* | float | Minimum layout height in points. |

The defaults ship 13 rules that set minimum sizes for apps with known resize floors (Codex, Commander One, Chrome, Zed, Safari, Zen, Firefox, Dia, Spotify, Discord, Ghostty, Outlook, Messages).

```toml
[[appRules]]
bundleId = "com.apple.Safari"
id = "81426D13-C1A5-475E-AFBC-00BBA05042D0"
minHeight = 220.0
minWidth = 574.0
```

## Per-monitor overrides

Six arrays hold per-monitor exceptions to the global tables. Every entry identifies its monitor with `monitorName` (required) plus optional `monitorDisplayUUID` and `monitorDisplayId`; all entries except orientation also carry an `id` UUID. Override keys are all optional — an omitted key falls back to the corresponding global setting. All six arrays default to empty. Custom routing grids live separately in [`routing.arrangements`](#routing).

| Array | Overridable keys |
| --- | --- |
| `monitorBarOverrides` | `enabled`, `showLabels`, `showFloatingWindows`, `deduplicateAppIcons`, `hideEmptyWorkspaces`, `reserveLayoutSpace`, `notchMode`, `notchActiveZoneWidth`, `position`, `windowLevel`, `height`, `backgroundOpacity`, `xOffset`, `yOffset` — see [`workspaceBar`](#workspacebar) |
| `monitorOrientationOverrides` | `orientation`: `horizontal` or `vertical` layout orientation for that monitor |
| `monitorNiriOverrides` | `visibleContainerCount`, `centerFocusedColumn`, `alwaysCenterSingleColumn`, `singleWindowFit`, `infiniteLoop` — see [`niri`](#niri) |
| `monitorDwindleOverrides` | `smartSplit`, `defaultSplitRatio`, `splitWidthMultiplier`, `singleWindowFit`, `useGlobalGaps`, `innerGap` — see [`dwindle`](#dwindle) |
| `monitorGapOverrides` | `innerGap`, `outerGapLeft`, `outerGapRight`, `outerGapTop`, `outerGapBottom`, `fullscreenUsesOuterGaps` — see [`gaps`](#gaps) |
| `monitorFrontAndCenterOverrides` | `sizeRatio` — see [`frontAndCenter`](#frontandcenter). The whole array is optional and absent from files written before it existed |

```toml
[[monitorGapOverrides]]
id = "0B54A3C1-6E1B-4D5B-9A64-2F0D8A11C001"
innerGap = 8.0
monitorName = "DELL U2720Q"
outerGapTop = 4.0
```

These are most easily managed from **Settings > Monitors** and the per-layout tabs, which record the display's UUID automatically so the override survives display reconnects.
